## About Audio

___Version : v0.1.1 or higher___

I use ``NAudio`` to play audio, but NAudio can't work on Linux OS or macOS.

So I added a feature which allows users to choose how to play audio (``NAudio`` or ``FFMpeg``).

The default selection mode is ``auto``:

&emsp; If you use Windows OS, it will select ``NAudio``. Otherwise it will use ``FFMpeg``.
